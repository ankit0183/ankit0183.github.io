excerpt: "Remote is a beginner's box running a vulnerable version of the Umbraco CMS which can be exploited after we find the credentials from an exposed share. After landing a reverse shell, we find that the machine has TeamViewer installed and we can recover the password with Metasploit then log in as Administrator."
