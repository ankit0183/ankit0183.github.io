The box has a code review part where we analyze the source code of a PHP web app to find a command injection vulnerability in a curl command. We then use the Gopher protocol to perform SSRF and write a serialized PHP payload into the memcache database. For the priv esc part, we manipulate attributes of a user in an LDAP database which is used by the NSS facility to extend the Linux authentication database.
